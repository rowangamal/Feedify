### note
- (friday 13/12/2024) After that we has a huge block due to naming of the files on Windows and Linux make us block for more than 6 h.
- Error was the naming of folder Component in frontend as there were two folders .

    - component
    - Component
- As Windows is insensitive with naming of folders & Linux was sensitive.
- #### **Solution**
    - remove one of folder.
